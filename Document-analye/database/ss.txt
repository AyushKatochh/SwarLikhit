{"text": " Welcome to the Deep Dive Data Podcast, where we explore the latest developments and trends in AI and machine learning. Today, we'll be talking about explainable AI for XAI, a hot topic in the AI community. Joining us today is Ms. Mary Palos, Assistant Professor of AITCSE in Chundigar University. Ms. Mary, thank you for joining us today. Thank you for having me now, me. To start off, can you give us a brief overview of what XAI is and why it's becoming increasingly important? Sure. It's the AI stands for Explainable Artificial Intelligence. Explainable AI is a set of crosses, methods that allows human users to comprehend and first, results and output created by machine learning algorithms. Explainable AI is used to describe an AI model. It's expected impact and helps characterize model accuracy, fairness, transparency, and outcomes in AI-powered decision making. This is becoming increasingly important, as AI is being integrated into more and more aspects of our lives, from healthcare to the NAND to criminal justice to autonomous vehicles. We need to be able to trust the decisions that AI models make, and that starts with understanding of how they make those decisions. That's a great point, and it raises the question, why are traditional AI models not explainable? Traditionally, AI models such as deep neural networks are the sign you learn from data and make predictions, but they are not designed to be easily interpretable by humans. These models can have hundreds or even thousands of parameters, making it difficult to understand how they arrived a particular decision. As ML models are often thought of as black boxes, because sometimes no clarity on what features are variables in the data are being used to make a prediction. So what are some of the challenges in making AI models more explainable? There are several challenges in making AI models, and to make the models more explainable. One of the main challenges is finding a balance between accuracy and interpretability. Sometimes, making a model more interpretable can result in loss of accuracy and vice versa. Another challenge is the complexity within the AI models. Deep neural networks, for example, can have millions of parameters making it difficult to understand how they arrived at the particular decision. That's interesting. Can you give us some examples of how XAI is being used in the real world today? Absolutely. Explainable AI is being used in a variety of industries, including healthcare, finance and criminal justice. In healthcare, for example, explainable AI is being used to develop interpretable models that can help doctors diagnose diseases. In finance, explainable AI is being used to create models that can better understand and predict the likelihood of orthodoxism in offenders. Those are some great examples. Can you tell us about some of the latest developments in XAI? Yeah, there have been some exciting developments in explainable AI in recent years. One of the main developments is the use of interpretable mission learning techniques such as decision trees and linear regression. Which can be used to create models that are both accurate and interpretable. Another development is the use of techniques such as the Alliancy Maths and Layerwise Relevance Propagation. Which can be used to understand the importance of individual features in a model's decision. That's great to hear. Drop up what do you see as the future of XAI and what role will it play in the broader AI community? I believe that explainable AI will play a crucial role in the AI community and in building trust and confidence when putting AI models into production.
